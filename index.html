    i am currently enrolled in towers highschool. im the the tenth grade and i play varsity basketball. my position om the court is power forward (PF). 
    this years goal for  basketball is to become one of the starting 5. too meet this goal i would have to work harder. this means to practice my layups,
    freethrows,shots, and handwork. improving my skills will make me and so many other people very proud. even though i am a perfectionist i know that i
    am not perfect.

    at the age 15 i live with my brother. he provides everything he can for me in the best way possible. we are both learning together, which is hard
    because we didnt grow up together. Being around him for 3 years has changed my life complety in the best way. i know how to be independent now more 
    than ever. ive learned that the world doesnt evolve around me and i have to take on every oppurtinity that life gives me.
